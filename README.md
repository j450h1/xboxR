# xboxR
This a planned R package for the unofficial xbox one API - https://xboxapi.com/

* Currently a POC, shell script works to notify you when one of your friend's is online playing a certain game (PUBG in this example)

1. The environment variables that need to be set are:
* AUTH_KEY
* GAMERTAG
* XUID

For example: 
export AUTH_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
